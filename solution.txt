Solution to the game.

Commands:
Use "go" to navigate to the desired direction. E.g go west
Use "get" to acquire the items. E.g get keys

Plot:
- There are 10 locations
- Ghost is in Dining Room
- First you need to get 3 items (keys, phone, wallet), that then unlocks 4th item (wand). This will wipe the Ghost from the house.
- You need to be in Garage with all items to win
- Failure to get the wand and arriving at Dining Room (The only way to garage) will lead to you to loose the game

Solution:
>go west
>get keys
>go east
>go south
>get phone
>go east
>get wallet
(At this point, you have all 3 items currently available. This will unlock magic wand in Guest room)
>go west
>go north
